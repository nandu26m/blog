When you perform customer segmentation, you find similar characteristics in each customer's behaviour and needs. Then, those are generalized into groups to satisfy demands with various strategies. Moreover, those strategies can be an input of the

* Targeted marketing activities to specific groups
* Launch of features aligning with the customer demand
* Development of the product roadmap

There are different products/solutions available in the market from packaged software to CRM products. Today, I will apply an unsupervised machine learning algorithm with Python I will apply K-Means clustering to the dataset with the following steps.
1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Visualization and Interpretation of the Results
